🩺 Diabetes Risk Predictor Project
📌 Overview

Diabetes is a chronic illness affecting millions worldwide, with rising prevalence in Kenya and other developing regions. Early detection is crucial for preventing complications and reducing long-term healthcare costs.

This project builds a machine learning model to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic using demographic, lifestyle, and clinical features.

The dataset (from Kaggle) contains:

Age

Gender

BMI

Blood Glucose Level

Hypertension Status

Smoking History

HbA1c Level

The goal is to provide an interpretable and reliable tool that supports screening programs, early interventions, and public health decision-making.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas & NumPy → data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn → visualization

Scikit-learn → model building & evaluation

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code → development

📊 Project Workflow

Data Collection – Downloaded dataset from Kaggle.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Used graphs and plots to identify trends, correlations, and outliers.

Feature Engineering – Selected the most impactful features for prediction.

Model Building – Trained different models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).

Model Evaluation – Compared accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Final Model Selection – Chose the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

Visualization of Results – Highlighted patterns such as the impact of BMI, HbA1c, and hypertension on diabetes risk.

✅ Final Recommendations

Healthcare providers can use such models to prioritize screening for individuals with high-risk indicators.

Public health programs should target awareness campaigns on weight management and blood sugar control.

Future improvements could include expanding the dataset with genetic and lifestyle data for better accuracy.

📖 Key Learnings

Data preprocessing and cleaning are as important as model building.

Simple models (e.g., Logistic Regression) can perform competitively with complex ones when data is well-prepared.

Visualization provides critical insights that enhance interpretability for non-technical stakeholders.

GitHub version control helped in project organization and collaboration readiness.
